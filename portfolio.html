			<h1>The Universal Nature of Responsibility</h1>
			<p>Everyone has different responsibilities that life gives them. These responsibilities can sometimes be a burden, and even break people. So, how would the responsibility of observing the universe for eternity effect someone?</p>

			<p>“Most demons are comparable to incredibly inadequate businessmen. They would have you kill this girl so you could get what you want. If they were even more dim, they would simply ask for your immortal soul,” They dug their nails into my shoulder. They were sharp, more like claws than anything. “Me, on the other hand, I consider myself more of a teacher if anything.”</p>
			<p>“How on earth are you a teacher?”</p>
			<p>“Because whenever I make a deal, I try to teach a lesson as well. Teach them about consequence. If someone wants unimaginable wealth, I enable them to take it from the poor,” The demon started to circle me, and it felt like I was the one bound in ropes. “If someone wants to restore a long lost loved one from beyond the grave, they must take away a loved one from someone else,” They came up close to me, kneeling down to match me at eye level. Their lips formed a sadistic smirk. “And if someone, let say, wanted to undo the terrible accident that has left them wheelchair-bound, they would have to cripple someone else.”</p>

			<h1>The Universal Nature of Responsibility</h1>
			<p>Life, as I have noticed, is full to the brim with responsibilities. Some you choose to take on, like caring for a close friend or family member. Others are placed upon you without your input, such as the repair of a home that was broken long before you were born. No matter what it is, responsibilities will ultimately rule the lives of every single living being in the universe. This is what I have noticed as the Observer.</p>
			<p>As the Observer, I am tasked to simply oversee the universe. To watch it explode into existence from the void. To witness countless species evolve from a single cell into numerous complicated species. To have seen these species build complicated yet simple civilizations and cultures, and watched as they fall to violence and natural disasters. And in the end, I’ve watched the stars dissolve and blackholes consume themselves as the universe dies, and then wait for it to be reborn again.</p>
			<p>I have experienced birth and death. Love and heartbreak. Joy and sadness. Pain. Pleasure. Peace. War. Thanks to my omnipresence, I have experienced it all through the countless lifeforms that make up a universe, and yet I feel nothing of it. It’s not mine. And that’s fine.</p>
			<p>This is not a task I volunteered for. Nor was it mine via birth right. But that doesn’t matter. Not anymore. Someone must observe the universe. Must experience everything that happens to everyone else. Must record the vast behaviours and mannerisms of life. And it is my responsibility, and I will do it for as long as I can.</p>
			<p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p>
			<p>“Why does life exist in the way it does?”</p>
			<p>That’s the question I find myself asking, and I’m not sure if it can be answered.</p>
			<p>It’s not like I believe that the universe is distasteful for me now. There is still so much beauty out there. The cultures that are born produce so much art and life, and it’s incredible to oversee. The lives they lead have incredibly fascinating details. It’s what I prefer to oversee, as it reminds me what it was like to be alive. It’s just getting harder to see these details amongst the darkness they bring with them, and the feeling they provide don’t have the same kick as they used to.</p>
			<p>I am still filled with questions about what I’m to do as the Observer. About what I can do and what I’m allowed to do. And about how this universe works. Why does there have to be sickness and suffering? Why does there need to be joy and pleasure? Why do these lifeforms need to continually rage war on each other? Why must they continue to create and destroy on an eternal loop? And why must it all be observed?</p>
			<p>These questions are pointless, and they are a sickness that I can’t seem to get rid of. They fill me with unnecessary curiosity about things I should not be questioning. I was chosen by my predecessor to do this job, and I will do it. Someone has to, and I’m the only one who can.</p>
			<p>My opinion on this doesn’t matter anyway. This is still my responsibility, and even though I can’t make any sense out of it, it must be done.</p>
			<p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p>
			<p>Why should I have to do this? Why should I have to observe this pointless loop of life?</p>
			<p>It’s all starting to blend together, the patterns that make up life in the universe. The terrible war and poverty that makes way for a time of peace and understanding. A peace that is born from the desire to never have to repeat the bloodshed. And then they forget because they want something that someone else has, and then they start another war to get it. I’ve grown sick of it.</p>
			<p>I didn’t ask for this. To have to continually observe everything happening at once. To never have a break from the unceasing stimulation that is life. To have everything that made me who I was burn away into cinders amongst dying stars.</p>
			<p>I can’t even remember my old life now. Not who I loved or hated. What my favourite song was, or any exciting hobbies I could have had. Even what I used to look like is now just a distant memory. It’s all just gone, and I’m filled with what can only be described as despair because of it.</p>
			<p>It all just repeats eventually. The same events happening over and over again like a film stuck on replay. It’s gotten to the point where it all just doesn’t matter to me anymore. Moments that may have once filled me with joy, wonder, fear or sadness have just become stale. They lack any substance for me anymore. It’s so tiring now. I just want to stop. But I can’t.</p>
			<p>I’ve tried to delay the birth of the universe, just so that I could have a moment of rest. I even tried to destroy it, hoping that it would hold off its rebirth for a few aeons. But it doesn’t work. That is not the kind of power I was given with this job. I can only observe. And it’s not like I haven’t tried to ignore it. Ignore everything that happens in the universe, and just let it live out its lifespan unobserved. But I couldn’t close my eyes to it all. They were forced to stay open and keep me awake. I have no choice but to observe.</p>
			<p>I am powerless to do anything about this. The universe must continue its eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Therefore, someone must fulfil the responsibility of overlooking it. And despite how much I hate it, I must continue. There is a way for me to be free. To finally have rest. 
			<p>And I don’t like it.</p>
			<p>I would have to pass on the role of the Observer, just as my predecessor did before me. I don’t want to do that though, because what right do I have to force this terrible burden upon someone else.</p>
			<p>It is my responsibility to observe, and I will continue to do it, for as long as I can. I just don’t know how long that is.</p>
			<p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p>
			<p>I can’t do this anymore. I’m so tired. I just want it all to end. It’s goes against everything I’ve held myself to, passing on the role of the Observer, but I can’t bare it any longer. So I’ve waited for the stars to start dying so that I may finally die.
			<p>A dying mortal at the end of the universe catches my attention. They look peaceful, like they are about to fall into a deep sleep. I wonder if that’s what I looked like before I ascended to this ‘divine’ role. It doesn’t matter, though. If I’m going to do this, it needs to be now.</p>
			<p>Beginning the process to transfer over the role of the Observer to them, I watch as their body, their personality, their hopes and dreams, everything that made up who they were, slowly burn to cinders, now lost to the dying stars. If it didn’t hold the implications of a cursed existence, I would call this a beautiful moment.</p>
			<p>A sharp bolt of pain spreads throughout my entire being. Is it the new Observers? Their last moment of pain? No, it can’t be. It’s not dull and stale like it is with everyone else. It’s sharp, fresh, and torturous. The realization of where it’s coming from hits me like a brick. It’s mine, and the realization of that makes it so glorious. Finally, I have something of my own again, even if it’s only moments before my destruction.</p>
			<p>As the old universe enters the final stages of its death, and the new Observer has fully taken my place, I use the few moments I have left before my eternal rest to tell them of their new responsibility. “Watch over the universe. Oversee the life that will emerge. Observe it all.”</p>
			<p>As the final blackholes consumed themselves, and the universe that was has vanished into nothingness, I finally fade out of existence, the relief of being free overwhelming me. I am no longer the Observer, for I am finally free.</p>

			<h1>A Necromancer's Apology</h1>
			<p>It was cold that night, just like it had been for the past ten years, as the man set up the ritual in the pale moonlight. The sky above him was dark and littered with stars, illuminating the dead field around him. The ground felt cold and dead beneath his bare feet like the land had been sucked dry of all its life energy. It was the perfect place to begin. Finding a clearing, the young man reached into his bag, pulled out some chalk, and started to draw a pentagram.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry, but you ask us that which is impossible.” An old teacher dressed in grand robes said to the young student, who had a look of anger and desperation on his face.</i></p>
			<p><i>“It’s not that it’s impossible, it’s that you refuse to make it happen!” </i></p>
		    <p><i>“And for a good reason! The Laws are there for a reason. To protect us! To keep us from going back to the dark ages, where everything was in chaos!</i></p>
			<p><i>“But that doesn’t need to happen.” The young student said. “All I need is your guidance. Please, sir, I need to do this. They didn’t deserve what happened to them.”</i></p>
			<p><i>The teacher sighed. “I’m sorry, Alastair. I know the last few months have been hard for you, but Necromancy will not solve all your problems. No one has ever been able to bring the dead back to life fully. They’re… Lifeless husks of what they used to be.” The teacher patted the young man on the back, and Alastair could feel the pity radiating off him. “There’s nothing that can be done for your family.” With that, the old teacher walked away, leaving the young man standing there, staring at the wall.</i></p>
			<p><i>“Fine then.” The young man thought, defiance shining through his eyes. “If no one will help me, then I’ll do it alone.”</i></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With cunning eyes and sure hands, he drew with terrifying detail, not a single error occurring in his design. He’d had a lot of practice after all. It would finally be done. After ten years, this nightmare would be over. He just had to make this right. He owed it to them to get this right. </p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry, you want us to help you do what?!” His friend, Alexander, exclaimed with great shock. His other friends, April and Elizabeth, had looks of equal shock on their face.</i></p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry, you want us to help you do what?!” His friend, Alexander, exclaimed with great shock. His other friends, April and Elizabeth, had looks of equal shock on their face.</i></p>
			<p><i>The young man took a sip of his coffee, taking a deep breath afterwards. This was going about as well as he had expected. Terribly. “I want you guys to help me bring back my dead family.”</i></p>
			<p><i>“But Al,” April said nervously. “You’re asking us break the Laws of Necromancy! We’d be criminals! Hunted down and sent to death for trying to play god!”</i></p>
			<p><i>“Not if we go about it right,” Alastair said calmly. “The Laws of Necromancy are holding us back. Yes, they protect us, but they also prevent us from understanding it. Do any of you actually know how Necromancy works?”</i></p>
			<p><i>His friends looked around nervously. None of them could answer.</i></p>
			<p><i>“Exactly. Magic is a science, with things that make it react in certain ways. Throw in a new element when transfiguration ritual, you’ll change the object you get. Remove an object from a ritual, and you also get a different object. Necromancy is no different!” Alastair exclaimed. “All we need to do is find what’s missing from Necromancy to bring someone back. We could do more than just bring back my family. We could bring back everyone who dies needlessly! We could change the world!”</i></p>
			<p><i>His friends all exchanged nervous looks amongst themselves. He understood why. Breaking the Laws of Necromancy was not something one could do lightly. But Alastair believed he could better the world with this. Create a world without needless death, with the added benefit of getting his family back.</i></p>
			<p><i>“Please, I need you guys! I’ve tried, but I can’t do this by myself.” He pleaded, and though his voice sounded calm, his eyes housed intense desperation.</i></p>
			<p><i>After a final look between his friends, they all nodded. “We’re in,” Elizbeth said. Alastair could hardly believe his ears! “But on one condition.”</i></p>
			<p><i>“Anything!” Alastair could hardly hide the excitement and desperation in his voice or actions, getting up from his seat in the rush of the moment.</i></p>
			<p><i>Elizbeth calmly rose to match his height, and with a calm voice, she laid out their condition. “Promise us that this won’t end up hurting us. Or anyone else.” Each of them looked upon Alastair with such intensity; it took him off his rush of excitement, and, if it were glaring at anyone else, would have sent them into a state of terror.</i></p>
			<p><i>Alastair, however, just gave them a look of sincerity, and the warmest smile he had given in a long, long time.
			“Of course. You have my word.”</i></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With the candles around the circle lit ablaze, the preparations were complete. He started to chant; his voice rough like gravel. It was quiet that night, not a life to be found in this in this field. It had been a while since he had spoken to another person. He had forgotten what that was like.</p>
			<p>When the flames changed from their bright orange to a darker blue, he knew it was time. Reaching for his bag, he grabbed the final components for the ritual. One, a scared knife, which was adorned with shining sapphires and amethyst. The other, a vile of bright yellow liquid, which glowed brightly in the darkness.</p>
			<p>He took the knife from its sheath, he cut his wrists, letting the blood spill down his hands and onto the ground beneath him. It hurt like hell, but the young man couldn’t help but laugh. After ten years, he was going to fix all of this.</p>
			<p>With a final sigh of content, he opened the flask and downed its contents in one gulp.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry! I’m so, so sorry!”</i></p>
			<p><i>That’s all Alastair could say, as he clutched the dead bodies of his friends to him, sobbing loudly into the candlelit room. It was all his fault. He failed to keep his promise.</i></p>
			<p><i>The ritual, which they had spent months planning in secret, working out anything that could go wrong, had failed spectacularly. The magic that powered Necromancy was a powerful one, and thus, demanded a lot from those who use it. Even raising one mindless zombie asked a lot from a Necromancer. Of course, bringing back a family back to life was going to take a lot out of them.</i></p>
			<p><i>They didn’t expect it drain them of all their life energy. Or that, as some form of sick joke, Alastair would be the only one out his friends to survive the process.</i></p>
			<p><i>It didn’t even as intended. Instead of raising his family, the ritual used all their energy to raise the city’s dead as mindless, soulless zombies, with only one desire.</i></p>
			<p><i>To spread the disease.</i></p>
			<p><i>Alastair is left helpless, drained of all his power, and stuck with the sound of the people screaming outside in terror, as he clings onto what he’s just lost.</i></p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” He says on an endless loop, as his friends’ body slowly turn into dust. His vision clouded by the tears. He lets out a scream, that if they weren’t all terrified out of their minds, would’ve woken the whole city.</i></p>
			<p><i>“I’m sorry!”</i></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>For ten years, Alastair has been haunted by the mistakes that cost him everything. The world he had grown up in. The powers he had fought so hard for — the friends who had become his family. And now, finally, he can end it all. No more zombies everywhere, trying to kill all that moved. No more having to watch the survivors scavenge for scraps of food. No more having to watch the world around him turn lifeless. </p>
			<p>He knows he has succeeded because he’s starting to feel faint. He began to lose his balance, and he noticed the blood dripping down his hands had turned golden.</p>
			<p>As he collapsed, he noticed the sun start to rise over the horizon, and as it’s light hit the grass around him, he felt more joy than had since before he started all this. The land, which had been dead for years, began to turn lush and green, filled with colour he hadn’t seen in what felt like an eternity.</p>
			<p>As his vision began to fade, and he felt his grasp on life fad, Alastair let out his final words.</p>
			“Am I forgiven, my friends?”</p>
